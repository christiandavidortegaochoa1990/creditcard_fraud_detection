# Credit Card Fraud Detection
A comprehensive analysis and machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions efficiently and accurately. This project focuses on identifying patterns in transaction data, overcoming class imbalance issues, and deploying advanced techniques to ensure reliable predictions.

# üìù Overview
This project explores and develops a fraud detection system using real-world transaction data. Given the significant impact of fraudulent transactions, the analysis aims to identify and classify fraudulent behavior based on past data. The objective is to maximize recall (correctly identifying fraud) while maintaining a balance with precision to avoid false positives.

# üöÄ Key Insights
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 

- Identified class imbalance, with fraudulent transactions representing a small proportion of the data.
- Time and amount were scaled for more effective analysis.
- Clear patterns emerged in transaction behavior, helping refine the feature selection process.

**Feature Engineering:**

- Used StandardScaler to scale the Amount and Time features for model consistency.
- Dropped irrelevant or redundant features to improve model efficiency.

**Model Training & Evaluation:**

- Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier were trained and tested to compare performance.
- Addressed class imbalance using techniques such as stratified sampling.
- Models were evaluated using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix to ensure both accuracy and reliability in fraud detection.

# üìä Results and Conclusions
- Random Forest Classifier outperformed Logistic Regression, achieving higher recall, which is critical for detecting fraudulent transactions.
- Although the Random Forest model introduced more false positives, it successfully minimized missed fraud cases (false negatives), ensuring higher operational security.
- Key takeaway: Prioritizing recall is essential in fraud detection systems to avoid undetected fraudulent activity, even at the cost of occasional false positives.
